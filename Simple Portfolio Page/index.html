      <h2>Early Detection of Lung Cancer using Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <p><br>Abstract: In this computer era, we are totally going with the automation of everything, in the same way the medical industry is also automated with the help of image processing and data analytics. The best way to control the death caused by cancer is early detection. The medical image or a CT scan image is pre-processed. The contrast of the image is increased with the CLAHE Equalization technique. Then it is segmented with the help of the random walk segmentation method. Introduction: Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that take in oxygen when you inhale and release carbon dioxide when you exhale. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. People who smoke have the greatest. </p>

      <h2>Machine Learning based Prototyping of GUI for Mobile Apps</h2>
      <p>Abstract: It is common practice for developers of user-facing software to transform a mock-up of a graphical user interface (GUI) into code. This process takes place both at an applicationâ€™s inception and in an evolutionary context as GUI changes keep pace with evolving features. Unfortunately, this practice is challenging and time-consuming. In this project, we present an approach that automates this process by enabling accurate prototyping of GUIs via three tasks: detection, classification, and assembly.
<br>
Introduction: Most modern user-facing software applications are GUI-centric and rely on attractive user interfaces (UI) and intuitive user experiences (UX) to attract customers, facilitate the effective completion of computing tasks, and engage users. Software with cumbersome or aesthetically displeasing UIs is far less likely to succeed, particularly as companies look to differentiate their applications from competitors with similar functionality.</p>

      <h2> Big Sales Predicton using Random Forest Regressor </h2>
      <p>Abstract: Project Overview: The objective of this project is to predict sales of items using a Random Forest Regressor. The dataset contains information about various items and their sales across different outlets. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts item outlet sales based on several features.</p>
